  abstract = {In this paper, an overview is presented of the existing metaheuristic solution procedures to solve the multi-mode resource-constrained-project scheduling problem, in which multiple execution modes are available for each of the activities of the project. A fair comparison is made between the different metaheuristic algorithms on the existing benchmark datasets and on a newly generated dataset. Computational results are provided and recommendations for future research are formulated.}
